### Use:
1. Run setup.m.
2. Open initSimulationParams.m.
    1. Input initial Keplerian elements.
    2. Input simulation time in days and step time in seconds.
3. Run mainKeplerGroundTrack.m or mainNewtonGroundTrack.m.

Note: mainKeplerGroundTrack.m uses Kepler's and mainNewtonGroundTrack.m uses Newton's equation.
